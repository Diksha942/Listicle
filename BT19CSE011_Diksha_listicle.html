                The most familiar form of energy in our daily lives is electrical energy. The branch of 
                engineering which deals with producing, managing and utilizing this energy, is referred 
                as electrical engineering. This field of engineering was introduced in an organized manner 
                in the mid of 19th century. Interest in this field of study grew after the invention of 
                electricity. It was June 1752 when Benjamin Franklin first tried to catch electricity from 
                clouds during a heavy storm with the help of a flying kite. This was the beginning and to date
                 still we are trying to manage this energy.

            <div class="section-heading">Chemistry Laboratory</div>
            <a class="location" href="http://vnit.ac.in/chemical/index.php/organic-chemistry-and-synthesis-lab/">Organic and Synthesis Lab, VNIT</a>

                The Lab is based on the idea that lab experiments can be taught using the Internet,
                more efficiently and less expensively. The labs can also be made available to students 
                with no access to physical labs or where equipment is not available owing to being 
                scarce or costly. This helps them compete with students in better equipped schools and 
                bridges the digital divide and geographical distances. The experiments can be accessed 
                anytime and anywhere, overcoming the constraints on time felt when having access to the 
                physical lab for only a short period of time.
